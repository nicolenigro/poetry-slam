She snaps the heads
off dried anchovies,
their eyes a black
ant hill burying my toes.

I’m breaking doenjang
with the flat head
of a metal spoon,
stirring the boomerang
silver bodies she drops.

Whenever she feels
like showing up, we cook
together. She opens
the tofu, smashes
the watery curd with her
foot, and soaks

a package of dried kelp
in the trash. The brittle
pieces like unspooling
magnetic tape.

Today, she sticks her white face
through this seaweed curtain,
red lips smearing,
whispering look

look this is just like my hair. 
Why don’t you ever
brush it? She disappears.

Now she chatters about
how much salt I’ll ingest
by putting that much
doenjang in, scooping
the anchovy eyes and
dumping them in the stew.

Aren’t you supposed
to be bothering men?
You’re from paradise--
why are you here?

She rises up. Her arms
hang like wet ropes,
head tilting until
her chin points
to the ceiling.

She cries, Why am I
here? None of my mothers
will tell me why I am here.
