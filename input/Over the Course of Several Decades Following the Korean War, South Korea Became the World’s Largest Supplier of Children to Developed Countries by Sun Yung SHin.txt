Some(where a) woman wears
 
the face once given. Possessions
 
scarce we go halves on slant
 
of eye & span of palm with cousin & other
 
ghosts. Where is the man with the face lent
 
mother? Fathers rare; infant found
 
at Shinkyo police station box--official
 
shoes careened around fortune of Name
 
& birth, pin &
 
note. Elsewhere (Norway, Australia)
 
another Korean
 
National bears the imprint
 
of my din. Cribs, nurse, hands, rice-milk powder, down
 
& rocked--carefully dated
 
checks. American/Father
 
asks Why. We donâ€™t speak. Years
 
burn to decades, this permanent
 
occupation.
