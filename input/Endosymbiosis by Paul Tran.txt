It wasn’t him
but what he did
that lived on

inside me.
I had to
learn that.

I had to
cleave  action
from figure,

the verb  do
from the noun  doll.
I had to

imagine
the double ll
not as two walls

closing in,
two bodies
side by side

in a twin bed,
two mirrors
facing

each other,
two tally marks
for the first and second

time I was ...
but a road
through

Hell--this
near contraction
of  he and  will--

where the difference
punctuation makes
could be missed.
