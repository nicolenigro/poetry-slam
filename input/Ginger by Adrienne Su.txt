We’ll affirm its arrival
when it’s not in the titles
of recipes in which it figures
quietly, as moderate slivers.

When it’s always available,
not lumped with root vegetables
nor flecked with blue mold.

When everyone knows
not to bite the large pieces.

When everyone preaches
the best means of peeling
(knife, spoon, or not-peeling)
and disagrees, without violence.

When its unexpected absence
causes fundamental hunger
but it’s like running out of sugar:
you can ask any neighbor.

When the nation remembers
how it treated as barbaric
the eaters of garlic
as they fled persecution

and sees its reflection
in black-and-white photos
of  mobs against risotto.
