You and I thigh deep in Suwannee River then in a bathtub. Spanish moss clogs
the drain and a man carrying a green towel interrupts. We send him away once
more knowing he'll return to watch. We're photographers shooting on location
for Sylvia Plath's upcoming book, Savage Beauty--wrong poet or wrong book,
I know, depending on how you look at it--however, I'm the one who is white
this time, you're darker, maybe Quechua Indian or Spanish, like actor Antonio
Banderas, with very defined stomach muscles and a slick throb of a penis.

Years later I write a book about our affair. They bring me on one of those
daytime talk shows, and before being reunited, we are kept in separate rooms, the
television split screen, green-towel man in the audience. I'm still white, so are you,
both of us middle-aged with freckles and strawberry-blonde hair. Later I'm the
viewer at home thinking, Like hell they'll fall for each other.
