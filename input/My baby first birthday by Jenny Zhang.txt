my mother had two vaginas
one to birth me and one to keep me
inside the first one I had two names
my given name and my other given name
my twat had a name too
it was forgotten because the climate changed
the climate changed because of  God
obviously
we as a society
stopped naming our twats
the old ways make way
for some way of  being again
in this world where we bury the old
inside their baby bodies
this way when we wake up from our dead sleep
we shall be little bright stars
dead to the world and dead to the love
our teeny tiny gods created
their cunts hugging so tenderly at the moment of creation
that I think this world was truly made for us
still we won’t live forever
we won’t know how to tell the others
who will have surely lived like we lived
inside the total darkness of their mothers too
where it doesn’t matter what we know and what we do not
