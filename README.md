	* From this article, I learned more about the form of a tanka. It follows a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern, with the first three parts (5-7-5) called the kami-no-ku and the final two parts (7-7) called the shimo-no-ku, which tend to make a pair. To honor the process of tanka poets, I wrote write_kaminoku() and write_shimonoku() functions.
