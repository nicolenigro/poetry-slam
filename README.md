# Poetry Slam

## Description
In honor of Asian Heritage Month (celebrated during April here at Bowdoin), I wanted my poetry generator to create poems in a form native to Asia and have my poems inspired by an inspiring set of poems by Asian American authors. I chose the tanka, which is a poetry form that originated in Japan in the seventh century. My inspiring set includes poem from Asian American authors I know of (and have read in New Fictions of Asian America with Professor Kong!) like Cathy Park Hong and Ocean Vuong and also up-and-coming poets I found on [Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/101589/asian-american-voices-in-poetry)

Tanka poems [do not traditionally have titles](http://www.graceguts.com/essays/why-say-more-the-problem-of-titling-tanka) which is why my tankas are titleless.

This system is a way for me to pay homage to recent Anti-Asian American violence and the Asian American component of my identity.

## How to Set Up and Run the Code

## Challenges
I had a lot of challenges installing packages that I wanted to use and dealing with errors in the terminal. I discovered that even though I have the latest version of Python installed, Python 2.7 was linked and the default, which created lots of problems. I troubleshooted errors by searching across the internet for different commands to fix all the problems I was having, and was ultimately able to implement all but 1 package, torchMoji. I ended up reaching out to the developer via email and it turns out it is not compatible with the version of Python I am running (3.9.4). Working through errors in the terminal was really tough, but I persevered and feel like I am now equipped to deal with all sorts of things related to running commands in the terminal.

## Scholarly Papers That Inspired My Approach
* [About Tanka](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19342039.2016.1120610)
	* From this article, I learned more about the form of a tanka. It follows a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern, with the first three parts (5-7-5) called the kami-no-ku and the final two parts (7-7) called the shimo-no-ku, which tend to make a pair. To honor the process of tanka poets, I wrote write_kaminoku() and write_shimonoku() functions.
* [Automatic generation of poetry: an overview](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hugo-Goncalo-Oliveira/publication/228610670_Automatic_generation_of_poetry_an_overview/links/00b7d517eea41271af000000/Automatic-generation-of-poetry-an-overview.pdf)
	* This article mentioned Manurung's taxonomy for poetry generation systems, and I was inspired to create a form-ware poetry generation system. In form aware-systems, the choice of words follows a pre-defined text form by following metrical rules (properties of grammaticality and poeticness). I was particularly inspired by Levy's POEVOLVE--a form-aware system--in which "the real process of human poetry writing is taken as a reference from which to draw the intuitions that drive the system" (3). From Levy's model, I decided to implement evaluator modules for analyzing and selecting the highest ranked poems for each generation as wall as conceptual and syntactical knowledge bases.
* [A Survey on Intelligent Poetry Generation: Languages, Features, Techniques, Reutilisation and Evaluation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-3502/)
	* Similar to the above article, this one also referenced Manurung. According to Manurung, besides poeticness, a poetic text "must obey linguistic conventions, prescribed by a given grammar and lexicon (grammaticality); and it must convey a conceptual message, meaningful under some interpretation (meaningfulness)." I incorporated grammaticality and meaningfulness by ________. The evaluation section also gave me some ideas for how I would evaluate the tankas generated by my poem. I was intrigued by evaluating a poem by emotions, understandability, grammar, unity, message. However this paper emphasized that it is hard to evaluate systems automatically, which is why I additionally had a live human reaction to/evaluation of my poetry.
* [Fixed Verse Generation using Neural Word Embeddings](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/79584968.pdf)
	* I was inspired by the classification process mentioned in this paper. I decided to tokenize sentences from my inspiring set into bigrams (2-word ngrams) with a create_ngrams() function. I also tag each word with POS-tags in my tag_words() function.
